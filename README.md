# Kotlin Sample

## Usage
`bin/compile.sh` compiles the code to the build/ folder.

`bin/mail.sh` starts the mail service.

`bin/order.sh` `ARG1` `ARG2` is used to make fruit orders with "Apple" and "Orange" parameters

`bin/test.sh` runs tests.

## Notes
I found most of the assignment interesting and fun to try out. I haven't had much Kotlin experience, but my Java knowledge seemed to come in handy. Also there is a bug in my mail implementation, but it should work just fine.

I also did this in .vscode, and just writing my own simple tests was easier than using a framework, in my opinion.

Thanks so much! I hope to be in touch soon.
